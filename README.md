Running
-------

You can't just browse the raw HTML files of the site. The links wont work, and it wont have a proper header or footer. If you want to run this website locally, you should install Flask and run the website as follows.

```
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-BasicAuth
python lispy.py
```

This will serve the site locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can browse it from there.
